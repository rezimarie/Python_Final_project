# Final_project
Hi, welcome to our final project,
we offer tools for both active or passive trading.

If you like active trading, look at our sheet Models and simulations.

If you like passive investing, you can use our tool for portfolio creation and analysis and than use Monte Carlo simulations to see how will the porfolio likely evolve.

We aslo specifically focus on energy companies, and comparison of sustainable and unsustainable energy companies, indicating whether the market situation is in favor of sustainable stocks or not

In the Model and simulations, assets (stocks) that you want to consider, time period and invested amount, and the tool will provide you with optimal weights among these assets, including projections of future development. The output is also coompanied by multiple visualisations.

For the "Models and Simulations" part, the idea is to first take individual stocks, and attempt to find appropriate models for predicting prices and returns using time series methods such as ARIMA and GARCH models, and basic machine learning models like XGBoost. After deciding on the models, we want to compare their performance by running simulations of trading returns and looking at their distributions. We will also include some baseline methods like "Random Buying" to see whether the trading strategies based on the models chosen perform better than random choice.
