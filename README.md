# Final_project
hi, welcome to our final project,
so far, we have created two notebooks, explanatory data analysis and models,
we plan to improve the code in both of these soon,

Right now, we have created a tool, where you input assets (stocks) that you want to consider, time period and invested amount, and the tool will provide you with optimal weights among these assets, including projections of future development. The output is also coompanied by multiple visualisations.

For the "Models and Simulations" part, the idea is to first take individual stocks, and attempt to find appropriate models for predicting prices and returns using time series methods such as ARIMA and GARCH models, and basic machine learning models like XGBoost. After deciding on the models, we want to compare their performance by running simulations of trading returns and looking at their distributions. We will also include some baseline methods like "Random Buying" to see whether the trading strategies based on the models chosen perform better than random choice.
