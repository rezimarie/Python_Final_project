# Final_project
Hi, welcome to our final project,
we offer tools for both active or passive trading. We also offer some insight into performance of sustainable companies, compared to unsistainable.

- If you  prefer passive investing, you can use our tool for **Portfolio creation and analysis**. Here you can input stocks (or assets) of your interest or choose some of the offered stocks, enter time period and amount you want to invest. The tool will provide you with optimal weights among these assets according to three different investing strategies. The tools also provies Monte Carlo simulations of future development of the porfolio. The output is also coompanied by multiple visualisations.

- If you like active trading, take a look at **Models and simulations**.  The idea is to first take individual stocks, and attempt to find appropriate models for predicting prices and returns using time series methods such as ARIMA and GARCH models, and basic machine learning models like XGBoost. After deciding on the models, we compare their performance by running simulations of trading returns and looking at their distributions. We also include some baseline methods like "Random Buying" to see whether the trading strategies based on the models chosen perform better than random choice.

- We also specifically focus on energy companies in sheet **To sustain or not to sustain**, where we offer comparison of sustainable and unsustainable ones, this can help to indicate whether the market situation is in favor of sustainable stocks or not. We do this by using our portfolio creation strategies and than observing, how many of the sustainable stocks made it to the final portfolio.
